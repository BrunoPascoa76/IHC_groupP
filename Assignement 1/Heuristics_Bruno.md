# Heuristics

# #1 Reporting System status: 2
When having connection problems while using the app, it instead keeps buffering instead of reporting lack of connection.

# #2 Match between the system and the real world: ? (1)
I have no idea on this one, though the grouping could use some work (the home button should not be grouping anything, as it is considered a "special button")

# #3 User Freedom: 0
This app is mostly read-only, so there's not a lot that the user needs an "emergency exit" for, although it has a home button.

# #4 Consistency: 1
Although the menu being assigned that icon and being on the top-left corner is very consistent, the home icon not being a house breaks consistency, as well as the fact that it doesn't only serve to bring you to the homepage. Furthermore, when choosing "events" for example, the icon changes, and the home button is now hidden behind a long press. An easilty identifiable home button that is always available is web design 101.

# #5 Error prevention: 0
Since non-user errors don't appear to count, then you can't prevent errors, if the user can't do anything to cause them.

# #6 Recognition: 2/3
Long steps for the most used tasks, home buttons that are unfamiliar and sometimes hidden makes recognition harder. The only saving grace is you can always just use the menu and read the labels. If you're not an Erasmus student, that is.

# #7 Flexibilty: 1/2
Customize the homepage. That's it. They could at least allow use to choose which information about a subject appears first, as we often go there for exams/time slots.

# #8 Minimalism: 0/1
There's unnecessary information on the homepage but it's not in the way, as the users rarely use the homepage anyways

# #9 Error messages: 3
You'd think a buggy app would have some type of error message but noooo, we just have to go by trial-and-error just to get it to start.

# #10 Help: 3
No help, no feedback, nothing, the only way to get help is to ask other users in person. There's not even a way for users to share their problems with other users.
