# Heuristics
# #1 Visibility of system status: 3
    When the app fails to log in, either due to a bug or lack of connection, the button's label either remains unchanged if it's due to a bug, or reverts back to it's original state if it's a lack of connection, without displaying any other noticeable change or message.
    In the case of a bug, the user will wait indefinetly for a response and in the case of a lack of connection, the button often reverts so quickly that the user just thinks that the button is unresponsive.
